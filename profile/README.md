## 🛡️ MotionPrint™ Technology

**World's first cryptographic watermark for 3D animations**

Using **Ed25519 digital signatures** (the same cryptography used in Bitcoin), MotionPrint™ embeds unforgeable proof of authorship directly into animation files — without altering the motion data.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔒 Privacy-First**: Files verified in-memory, never stored on servers
- **🌍 Public Verification**: Anyone can verify authenticity at [thirdrez.com/motionprint/verify](https://thirdrez.com/motionprint/verify)
- **📦 Multi-Format**: Works with GLB, GLTF, FBX, and BVH files
- **🎨 Non-Destructive**: Signatures embedded in metadata, preserving animation integrity
- **📜 Transparent Certificates**: Public registry with QR-coded proof of ownership

## 🌟 Our Mission

To democratize high-quality 3D animation by combining cutting-edge AI technology with human expertise, making professional-grade motion accessible to indie developers, content creators, and studios worldwide.

### 💡 The Problem We Solve

> *"In 2023, we needed hundreds of animations for a game project. Existing AI tools produced broken motion — feet sliding through floors, arms clipping through torsos, characters moving like gelatin.*
>
> *We spent 3 months just cleaning up 'AI-ready' assets.*
>
> *We realized: raw AI motion isn't a product — it's raw material that needs physics, refinement, and a human eye."*

**So we built Thirdrez**: AI-assisted motion + human craft + cryptographic trust.
